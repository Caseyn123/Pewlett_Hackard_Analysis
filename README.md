# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis
Mod 7 Analysis 
## The Purpose
The Purpose of this Analysis was to figure out how many people are retiring, and then figure out the employees who are eligible for the Mentorship Program. 
## Results
* One Major point regarding the people who are retiring is that there are a lot of Engineer positions on there which means that that department will be severely lacking once these employees retire
* A second major point is that there are also quite a bit of people retiring who hold the Senior position which means that there will not be as many senior titled/experienced workers anymore so they will have to train people to fill those positions too. 
* There are quite a bit of people who can be in the mentor ship program which means the company can plan better for these people who are retiring and make sure to get those retiring people into these mentorship programs to get them into these jobs that are being left open by the people who had them before because they are retiring. 
* because we ran the report for those who are retiring and are able to mentor those others into these retiring employee's jobs that means that there will be less fall out from the employees decision to retire. Which will help the company and the employees there too. 

## Summary 
10 roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" hits, more then half of them being Senior level roles is shown in the first picture on the deliverable challenge
